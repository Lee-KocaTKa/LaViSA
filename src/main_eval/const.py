You are a vision-language reasoning model performing structural disambiguation using visual context.

You will be given:
- an ambiguous caption
- an image

Your task is to select the correct interpretation of the caption based on the image.

Important:
- All options are derived from the same ambiguous caption and differ only in structural interpretation.
- You MUST use the image to decide.
- Do NOT rely only on textual plausibility.

2) Disambiguated caption with the right image (the caption is already disambiguated and matches the image)
